** Sentiment Analysis
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sentiment-analysis
   :END:
Sentiment analysis is an automated attempt to guess at the polarity of the sentiment conveyed in a given expression. For example, if you have a corpus of movie reviews, and you're interested in knowing whether a given review is likely favorable or unfavorable to the movie, and reviews have sentences like: "I really loved this movie!" and "I thought this movie was terrible," then you can use sentiment analysis to try to guess the sentiment conveyed. Sentiment analysis, as typically performed, usually has two types. /Lexical/ sentiment analysis looks up words in a dictionary. So you can imagine that it's not great with sentences like "I really didn't love this movie," since it will see "love" and will assume that it's a positive sentence. /Syntactic/ or /probabilisitic/ techniques, in contrast, take into account the structure of the sentence, and/or features learned (using machine learning) from labeled (manually entered) datasets, and are much better. But those techniques are much harder to do, so I'm just going to demonstrate a quick-and-dirty method, (i.e.Â easy, but inaccurate) using the =textblob= library.

If you don't already have =textblob= (and I don't think it comes with Anaconda), you might have to run =conda install -c conda-forge textblob= from a terminal or command-line, in order to install it on Anaconda.

#+begin_src python
  from textblob import TextBlob
  import pandas as pd
  from nltk import sent_tokenize
  %matplotlib inline
#+end_src

First, we'll get some test texts to play around with, from Dubliners:

#+begin_src python
  eveline = open('eveline.md').read()
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  eveline[:200]
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  '\n## EVELINE\n\nSHE sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head\nwas leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour\nof dusty cretonne. She was tired.\n\nFew peop'
#+end_example

Make it into a =TextBlob= object:

#+begin_src python
  evelineBlob = TextBlob(eveline)
#+end_src

Which gives us access to the =.sentiment= property, containing both =.polarity= and =.subjectivity=. Polarity is whether the sentence is positive or negative; subjectivity is how much sentiment is present. A sentence like "I really love this OMG!!!1!" would have high subjectivity, for instance, while a sentence like "the cat is in the house" would have low subjectivity.

#+begin_src python
  evelineBlob.sentiment
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  Sentiment(polarity=-0.008591667278107956, subjectivity=0.45734867298426624)
#+end_example

#+begin_src python
  dubliners = open('dubliners.md').read()
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  dubParts = dubliners.split('##')
#+end_src

Grab a few stories:

#+begin_src python
  nope, sisters, encounter, araby, eveline = dubParts[:5]
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  eveline[:100]
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  ' EVELINE\n\nSHE sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head\nwas leaned against '
#+end_example

#+begin_src python
  fourStories = [sisters, encounter, araby, eveline]
  allStories = dubParts[1:]
#+end_src

Turn them into =TextBlob= objects:

#+begin_src python
  fourBlobs = [TextBlob(text).sentiment
              for text in fourStories]
#+end_src

Grab their sentiment polarities:

#+begin_src python
  fourSentiments = [item.polarity
                   for item in fourBlobs]
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  fourSentiments
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  [-0.008060086400893564,
   0.07032967290973487,
   -0.03624764467357063,
   -0.008591667278107956]
#+end_example

And plot them, labeling the rows while we're at it:

#+begin_src python
  pd.Series(fourSentiments, index=['The Sisters', 'An Encounter', 
                                   'Araby', 'Eveline']).plot(kind='bar')
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f7746e95780>
#+end_example

#+caption: png
[[file:15-Everything-Else_files/15-Everything-Else_21_1.png]]

Let's try this again but with every sentence in "Eveline," as another example:

#+begin_src python
  eveline = open('eveline.md').read()
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  evelineSents = sent_tokenize(eveline)
#+end_src

How many sentences are there?

#+begin_src python
  len(evelineSents)
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  130
#+end_example

Make a list of all the polarities of all the sentences:

#+begin_src python
  evelineSentiments = [TextBlob(sent).sentiment.polarity
                      for sent in evelineSents]
#+end_src

And now we can iterate through all these, and the sentences too, zipping them together with =zip()= and writing a =for= loop to move through both of them at the same time:

#+begin_src python
  for sent, sentiment in zip(evelineSents, evelineSentiments): 
      print(sentiment, sent.replace('\n', ' ')[:80])
#+end_src

Finally, plot the sentiment polarity, by sentence:

#+begin_src python
  pd.Series(evelineSentiments).plot()
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f4e9929ec50>
#+end_example

#+caption: png
[[file:15-Everything-Else_files/15-Everything-Else_32_1.png]]

We can smooth that out using rolling averages:

#+begin_src python
  pd.Series(evelineSentiments).rolling(window=20).mean().plot()
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f4e94eda668>
#+end_example

#+caption: png
[[file:15-Everything-Else_files/15-Everything-Else_34_1.png]]

We could also try that by paragraph, if we wanted:

#+begin_src python
  evelineParas = eveline.split('\n\n')
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  len(evelineParas)
#+end_src

#+begin_example

* Macro-Etymological Analysis
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: macro-etymological-analysis
  :END:
Macro-etymological analysis simply looks up the parent languages, and parent language families, of each word in your text, and tabulates them accordingly. For this import statement to work, you must first have run =git clone= on [[https://github.com/JonathanReeve/macro-etym][the =macroetym= repository]], and either make sure the module is in your current working directory, or globally available, after installing it with something like =pip3 install .= or =conda install .=. This isn't easy to do, so let me know if you have trouble installing this, and we can work through it together.

#+begin_src python
  from macroetym import main
#+end_src

First, create a macro-etym =Text= object, and tell it the language is English. =Macro-etym= uses the standard three-letter language codes.

#+begin_src python
  eveText = main.Text(eveline, lang='eng')
#+end_src

Then, get language stats for "Eveline":

#+begin_src python
  eveText.getStats()
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  {'ang': 59.471094710947106,
   'deu': 0.36900369003690037,
   'dum': 0.36900369003690037,
   'fas': 0.12300123001230011,
   'fra': 5.07380073800738,
   'frm': 2.3062730627306274,
   'fro': 13.284132841328415,
   'grc': 1.107011070110701,
   'heb': 0.36900369003690037,
   'ita': 0.18450184501845018,
   'lat': 6.826568265682657,
   'non': 4.059040590405904,
   'xno': 6.4575645756457565}
#+end_example

That tells us that "Eveline" has 59% words of Old English (=ang= is the three-letter language code for Old English), 13% words of Old French origin, 9% words of Latin origin, etc. This can tell us a lot about the level of formality of the text, or its generic resonances. We can also get language family stats, too:

#+begin_src python
  eveText.getFamilyStats()
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  {'Germanic': [('ang', 59.471094710947106),

    ('deu', 0.36900369003690037),
    ('dum', 0.36900369003690037)],
   'Hellenic': [('grc', 1.107011070110701)],
   'Indo-Iranian': [('fas', 0.12300123001230011)],
   'Latinate': [('fro', 13.284132841328415),
    ('fra', 5.07380073800738),
    ('xno', 6.4575645756457565),
    ('lat', 6.826568265682657),
    ('frm', 2.3062730627306274),
    ('ita', 0.18450184501845018)],
   'Semitic': [('heb', 0.36900369003690037)]}
